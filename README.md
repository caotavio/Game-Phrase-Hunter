# Project-4---OOP-Game-Show-App
A Phrase Hunter Game that uses Object Oriented JavaScript to better organize the code.
Jquery is also used for cleaner and more readable code.
In this app a phrase is randomly chosen from an array of phrases and the number of letters is with the due spaces are displayed
in the screen in form of placeholders that hide the actual letters. If the user clicks on a letter that is on the selected phrase
it will replace the placeholder and disable the virtual button in question, but if the guess in incorrect a "heart" will be taken
away. The player has 5 hearts or guesses to try to win the game. A "win" or "lose" screen will appear and the player will be able
to press the start game button to get a new phrase and play again.
